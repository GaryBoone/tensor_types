  = help: the following other types implement trait `From<T>`:
            <i64 as From<bool>>
            <i64 as From<i8>>
            <i64 as From<i16>>

            <i64 as From<Scalar>>
          and $N others
  = note: required for `f64` to implement `Into<i64>`
  = note: this error originates in the macro `tensor_type` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
