   = help: the following other types implement trait `From<T>`:
             <i64 as From<bool>>
             <i64 as From<i8>>
             <i64 as From<i16>>

             <i64 as From<u8>>
             <i64 as From<u16>>
             <i64 as From<u32>>
             <i64 as From<Scalar>>
           and $N others
   = note: required for `MyStruct` to implement `Into<i64>`
   = note: this error originates in the macro `tensor_type` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
