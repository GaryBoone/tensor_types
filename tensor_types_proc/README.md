This crate provides the tensor_type macro to the tensor_types crate.

Note: Do not use this crate directly. Instead, use the
[tensor_types](https://crates.io/crates/tensor_types) crate. See the repository at
[github.com/GaryBoone/tensor_types](https://github.com/GaryBoone/tensor_types) for more information.

This crate exists as a standalone crate because of the way proc_macros work in Rust. In
addition, Crates.io does not recognize sub-crates, so this crate appears as a standalone crate.
